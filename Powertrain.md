********************************************************************
**Results Calculations: 

**The winner of the competition will be the Team with the highest energy efficiency result in their vehicle class and energy category, within the valid attempts as defined for each competition.

**For all vehicles, the results will be calculated based on the propulsion energy consumed PLUS the electrical energy consumed by the vehicle as measured by a joulemeter. In cases where the net electrical energy consumed by the vehicle, as measured by the joulemeter, is negative, no energy (or fuel) credit will be added to the results. This case may occur in Internal Combustion Engine vehicles that include engine powered charging of the battery.

**NOTES

**Electrical safety 
i. All electrical equipment used must be properly fused. ii. Electrical cables must be in good condition and appropriate for the equipment it is intended for. iii. Teams are only allowed to use the supplied single multi-plug strip with internal overcurrent protection. No further multi-plug strips or other adaptors may be used.

**For safety reasons, the maximum voltage on board of any vehicle at any point must not exceed 48 Volts nominal or 60 Volts max. This includes on-board batteries, external batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cell stack, etc.*

For battery electric vehicles this is called the propulsion battery, which means that an accessory battery is not allowed. Battery definition: A ‘battery’ is defined as a source of electrical energy, which has exactly two connectors and can be described as a unit. This unit may contain more than one subunit. If more than one sub-units are used they should be packaged together in a single physical package. 

The package may be made of any material provided it contains the entire battery. 
c) The battery must be fixed outside of the Driver’s compartment behind the bulkhead. (See Article 27) Batteries mounted directly under the driver’s seat are not allowed.

d) If Lithium-based batteries are used,
i. Battery Management Systems (BMS) must be tailored to the lithium chemistry to control and protect the battery against risk of fire. 
1. The BMS must provide cell balancing and overvoltage protection during off-track charging. 

2. For battery electric vehicles, the additional requirement of cell level over-discharge, cell level overcurrent and battery over-temperature must be provided as part of the on vehicle system. The BMS must AUTOMATICALLY isolate the battery, without operator intervention, if a limit or out of range condition is reached on any of the above parameters. 

3. For battery electric vehicles, the on-vehicle BMS must be located in the physical battery package and be powered directly by the battery. (See Article 57:b)ii above.) 


ii. For all self-built batteries, the following applies (note: a battery with a separately purchased BMS is also considered a self-built battery). Shell Eco-marathon 2024 Official Rules, Chapter I 30 
1. If there are one or more cells or modules, the overcurrent protection value for cells in parallel must be selected such that under normal operating or expected failure conditions, no single cell will be exposed to current beyond its rating. 
2. All cells or modules must be identical in configuration. (i.e. a battery constructed from cells of different capacities is not allowed). If the BMS is purchased separate from the battery, ensure it is compatible with battery chemistry. Example: Li-Polymer (LiPo) batteries require a BMS designed for LiPo batteries.

iii. Charging of batteries must be done with the battery charger purchased together with the battery or a purpose-built charger specifically suited to the given battery chemistry. For self built batteries, Teams must demonstrate that the charger is suitable and is integrated with the BMS system. 

iv. The maximum capacity of any Lithium-based battery used is 1,000 Wh. For batteries not rated in Wh, the Wh rating is calculated by multiplying the amp-hour rating of the battery by its nominal voltage. 

v. Protection for Lithium-based battery charging, whether in or out of the vehicle must be provided, see Article 24:h). 

vi. Any Lithium based battery must be equipped with a solid metal containment tray under the battery OR the battery must be enclosed in a battery charging bag. Either the tray or bag must be securely mounted and suitable to prevent the battery, in the event of a battery fire, from burning through the battery mounting or the vehicle body and dropping to the ground or in the engine compartment in the event of a vehicle rollover. Velcro or similar materials that will melt are not permitted to be used in battery mounting. Lightweight aluminum, other semi-metallic materials, or non-solid trays are not acceptable as metal containment.

vii. Power tool or hand-held equipment batteries are not permitted as a Battery Electric vehicle propulsion battery. 

viii. Printed manufacturer’s documentation for lithium-based batteries and the associated battery management system must be available for review during technical inspection. (See Article 58:c) 

e) All batteries and Supercapacitors must be short circuit protected. Protection may be in the form of a fuse, fusible link, or a current interrupting device (circuit breaker). Automatic reclosing current interrupting devices are not allowed. Short circuit protection devices must be located on the positive conductor and as close as possible, or a maximum 300 mm from the positive terminal of the battery or Supercapacitor. The rating of the short circuit protection device must enable the battery or Supercapacitor to always supply enough short circuit current to open the device. For vehicles with a starter motor, the starter motor cable is NOT required to be protected. 

f) For safety reasons, both the positive and negative circuits of the propulsion battery (for Battery Electric vehicles) and Supercapacitors must be electrically isolated from the vehicle body, frame, and metal components. 

g) All vehicle electrical circuits must be protected against electrical overload. Overload protection may be in the form of fixed current limits within electric controllers or by the insertion of individual circuit fuses. 

h) Accessory battery Shell Eco-marathon 2024 Official Rules, Chapter I 31 

	i. The accessory battery provides all allowed vehicle electrical needs such as safety devices (windscreen wipers, lights, hydrogen sensors, hydrogen relays and hydrogen shutdown valve), ignition, fuel injection control, and starter motor. 

	ii. The accessory battery may also power electrically driven engine components such as engine oil and cooling pumps, electric turbo compounding, electromechanical variable valve timing, compressors/ blowers, etc. The use of electric fuel pumps is not allowed. Only Urban Concept vehicles can utilise electrically driven engine components. 

i) The following devices may be powered by batteries other than the vehicle battery provided they use built-in batteries: radio communication system and driver ventilation. 

j) All electrical/electronic enclosures purchased or built by the Teams must be made of transparent material or at least have a transparent cover to allow the technical inspectors to view the contents.

k) Electrical wiring must be in good condition, neat, secured and not close to moving parts. All wiring connections and terminations must be visible and easily accessible. Splices are not allowed.
